<h1>Lab 1: Geolocation and mobile optimization with Leaflet</h1>
<h2> TGIS 504, Winter 2020, Dr. Emma Slager<h2>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>In this lab, you will practice making web maps that recognize and design for both the unique constraints of mobile devices and their unique affordances. You will create a map that places a marker on the map based on the locational information provided by the user's device, include signifiers that indicate to the user the accuracy of their device's locational information, add functionality that switches the base map between light and dark based on whether the sun is up at the user's location, and utilize various other design conventions that optimize mobile map use. This lab also asks you to read relevant documentation on the technologies used and to answer a few questions about that documentation in order to assess your understanding of its contents.</p>
<p>This lab is based on the tutorial <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples/mobile/" target="_blank">Leaflet on Mobile</a>, with modifications and additions by myself. </p>
